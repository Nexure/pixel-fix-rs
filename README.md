<hr />

**Pixel Fix RS** is a rust port of the popular utility **"Pixelfix"**. This utility is designed to change the colors of completely transparent pixels in an image to match the color of the nearest non-transparent pixel.

### More Information:
- You can find extra information at the original tools respository [here](https://github.com/Corecii/Transparent-Pixel-Fix/blob/master/README.md#more-info)


### Designed to be a quick drag-and-drop tool:
1. Make your images
2. Select them all and drag them on to the pixelfix executable. The pixelfix executable will overwrite the original images with fixed copies.
3. Make sure there were no errors and close the console window
4. Use or upload your images. Your images should now look fine when resized.
